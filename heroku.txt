Heroku is a massive pain 

heroku login
heroku config: to see config vars are working
heroku apps: for applications
heroku run node server/config/seeds.js: to see the data properly
(remember this is based on relative path to seeds )




heroku create custon name: to make a new app 
heroku apps:destroy --app custom add

git remote -v : check what the git repo is connected with
